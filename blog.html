                <br>
                <p class="text-style">I came into my Coding program with so much excitement to learn something new. Since I had 
                    been a teacher for the past decade I was ready to learn again. I was going to take my strategies
                    of learning and studying and apply it to this whole new world. Then I started the program and I was 
                    met with archaic teaching methods that are being pushed out of the public schools for a reason.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-style"> There infront of the class was a podium, a microphone, a LCD projector, and my instructor. It was 
                    LECTURE time! Before I explain why this is an archaic teaching method. Let us explore how our brain works. 
                    Simply put we as human beings must make connections through numerous methods. When you connect with information 
                    it solidifies pathways in your brain. Being able to practice and relate it to an experience or story makes learning easier
                    and more authentic. The pathways off your nuerons fire off and the more they fire the more the casing
                    around those connections grows and strengthens your memory. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-style">
                    What kind of connection are we making through the lecture style of teaching? As an example the course I am in
                    is three hours long with live coding examples broken up by short ten minute activities. A lecture has numerous 
                    variables it needs to be successful. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <ol class="text-style">
                    <li>1. Engaging Presentation </li>
                    <li>2. Attention Span is Focused throughout the time.</li>
                    <li>3. Note-taking toward positive connection of knowledge.</li>
                    <li>4. No Listening or Sight Disabilities</li>
                    <li>5. Immediate Comprehension of the subject matter.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                    <p class="text-style">If the conditions above are not met lecture does not work and connections are not made. 
                        Personally I have a hard time focusing for extended periods of time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-style">   
                        What can we do to make coding instruction better? Consider a student is like a vending machine. Each student 
                        has a certain amount of slots to hold available information that can be processed. If it is loaded incorrectly nothing comes out. If you over fill it 
                        the machine explodes and then there are skittles everywhere. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text-style"> Now that we have a concept of students we need a buffet of learning styles to make connections. Pre-reading to introduce new concepts.
                        We need live demos of small nuggets of knowledge. Practice activities for each concept that
                        are achievable. Small directed and focues group activities and discussion. Concepts need to connect
                        an always build to a bigger picture. That picture must be clear like a puzzle box. There is a lot more to 
                        unpack here more than this blog post can hold.
