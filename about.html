                <p class="text-style"> My name is Michael Krier. I have spent the past 10 years as a middle school teacher.
                Now I am taking a hobby of web developing and turning it into my new career path. During my previous career
                I have gained numerous skills and knowledge to take into an new career path. Being a teacher has allowed me to interact
                with numerous databases, educational technologies, and social and communication apps. Being a teacher allowed me to
                constantly work on my problem solving skills, analysis, best learning practices. With these skills as my 
                foundation of my work ethic I am able to take these into any new career.</p>
                    <br>
                <p class='text-style'>I am currently a student of UNC's Coding Bootcamp. Here we have been working toward learning numerous 
                coding languages HTML, CSS, JavaScript to form our foundation. We are still diving into Node.Js, MySQL and others. 
                During my course I have dived into the web to find more resources and online education to build a solid foundation
                of wed development.</p>
                    <br>
                <p class='text-style'>Before UNC I graduated Appalachian State University with a Music Education degree. I have taught hundreds of students 
                how to play musical instruments. During my time as a teacher my students have found success in District and State Honors 
                Bands, Recieved Superior Ratings in Competitions, and going on to find success in college and beyond. I am willing to find
                take this success and work ethic into my next field.</p>
